# Expense Tracker App

Welcome to our award-winning Expense Tracker App repository! This application was born out of passion, innovation, and teamwork during an intense application development competition. With only **9 hours** on the clock, our team, led by myself and including the incredibly talented [@faizanmalik2023](https://github.com/faizanmalik2023) and [iarhamanwaar](https://github.com/iarhamanwaar), set out to build a solution that addresses the real-world problem of expense tracking. Our hard work paid off, as we were honored with the **first prize** for our innovative application.

## About The App

Built on **Flutter** and backed by **Firebase**, our Expense Tracker App is designed with user experience and functionality in mind. It offers a comprehensive set of features aimed at providing users with a seamless way to manage their finances.
