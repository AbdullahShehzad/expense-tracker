# Expense Tracker App

Welcome to our award-winning Expense Tracker App repository! This application was born out of passion, innovation, and teamwork during an intense application development competition. With only 9 hours on the clock, our team, led by myself and including the incredibly talented Faizan Malik and Arham Anwaar, set out to build a solution that addresses the real-world problem of expense tracking.
